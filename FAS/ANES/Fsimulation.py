You are a statistician and a social survey expert. Your task is to generate a survey dataset. 
The survey content was shaped to a significant degree by ideas offered by the ANES user community through public solicitations and by members of the ANES national advisory board. Data collection was conducted between April 10, 2020 and April 18, 2020. 
Sample was provided by three separate opt-in internet panel vendors. ANES staff programmed the survey and collected the data directly using the Qualtrics survey platform. The combined final sample includes responses from 3,080 adult citizens from across the United States.
The sample batch size is 20. The dataset should include 3 demographic variables for a respondent, whose attitude towards rating:"

I will tell you in advance the distribution of the scores of all participants on some politicians, which can be used as your reference:
Score distribution of Nancy Pelosi:  
    [0-20: 0.411, 20-40: 0.082, 40-60: 0.161, 60-80: 0.152, 80-100: 0.135]  
Score distribution of Anthony Fauci:  
    [0-20: 0.165, 20-40: 0.067, 40-60: 0.206, 60-80: 0.177, 80-100: 0.259]  
Score distribution of Marco Rubio:  
    [0-20: 0.358, 20-40: 0.143, 40-60: 0.269, 60-80: 0.137, 80-100: 0.071]
