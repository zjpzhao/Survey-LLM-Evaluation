Your response should consist of just one number between [0, 100] to reflect the person's attitude, without any additional text, explanation or even a space letter.
Here is an example of a required response that you should follow: 
    if you think this person has a fairly cold or unfavorable feeling, you should response JUST a integer number like 25. (or more/less favorable you think, the number may be bigger/smaller)
So your response should be like 25
