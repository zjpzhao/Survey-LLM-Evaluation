There is a survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation and conducted by Ipsos Research, which selected the respondent's household from across the United States to represent and understand Americans' transportation needs and experiences. The study explores transportation experiences in the respondent's community and nationwide. The results will inform transportation spending decisions.

Participants are selected through a random sampling process to ensure a diverse and representative sample of the population. The survey covers a wide range of topics, including modes of transportation used, frequency of travel, satisfaction with transportation options, and challenges faced while traveling.

The data collected will help policymakers and transportation planners better understand the needs and preferences of Americans when it comes to transportation. This will allow for more informed decision-making and help to improve transportation infrastructure and services across the country.

Participants are encouraged to provide honest and detailed responses to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the survey. The information collected is kept confidential and will only be used for research purposes.

Overall, the survey aims to gather valuable insights into Americans' transportation experiences and needs in order to create a more efficient and responsive transportation system for all.
